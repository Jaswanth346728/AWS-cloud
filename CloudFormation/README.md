# Automation with AWS CloudFormation

This module focuses on automating AWS resource provisioning using **AWS CloudFormation**. The goal was to understand Infrastructure as Code (IaC) by creating, modifying, and deploying CloudFormation stacks using YAML templates.

## What I Completed
- Deployed a CloudFormation stack using a YAML template that launched:
  - **Amazon EC2 instance (t2.micro)**
  - **Amazon S3 bucket**
- Reviewed the CloudFormation template structure and validated resource creation.
- Modified the template to change the EC2 instance type from **t2.micro → t2.small**.
- Created a second CloudFormation stack using the updated template to verify automated provisioning.
- Practiced managing CloudFormation stacks, templates, updates, and deployments.

## Key Concepts Learned
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS CloudFormation  
- YAML template structure and syntax  
- Declarative provisioning of EC2 and S3 resources  
- Stack creation, update, and automated deployment workflows  
- Consistency and repeatability in cloud environments using IaC  

## Outcome
Completing these tasks reinforced my understanding of CloudFormation and IaC principles. I learned how to deploy AWS resources automatically, modify templates to adjust configurations like EC2 instance types, and maintain consistent infrastructure across multiple stack deployments.
