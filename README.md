# Hi, I'm Jaswanth — Cloud & Generative AI Developer  
### Specializing in AI Systems, Serverless Architectures, and AWS Solution Architecture

I design and build **scalable, secure, and high-performance cloud architectures** using AWS.  
My experience spans Generative AI, RAG systems, serverless automation, VPC networking, and distributed system design-skills directly aligned with AWS **Solution Architect** roles.

---

##  What I Do
- Architect **production-ready RAG systems** using OpenSearch Serverless, Bedrock Embeddings, and S3  
- Build **end-to-end AI platforms** with Bedrock Agents, Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB  
- Design **scalable, serverless backend architectures** using event-driven patterns  
- Architect **multi-tier VPC networks**, route tables, ALBs, NACLs, and private/public subnets  
- Implement **security-centered designs** using IAM boundaries, roles, KMS encryption, and least-privilege access  
- Optimize costs through **serverless-first**, on-demand scaling, S3 storage tiers, and intelligent workload placement  

---

##  Solution Architecture Skills
- Designing **high availability (HA)** and **fault-tolerant** architectures  
- Implementing **multi-VPC, multi-account** architectures using VPC peering and IAM separation  
- Applying the **AWS Well-Architected Framework** across all five pillars  
- Building **resilient API architectures** using Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB  
- Designing **distributed caching** and edge delivery using CloudFront  
- Enforcing **network isolation** with security groups and network ACLs  
- Designing **end-to-end data pipelines** using S3 → Lambda → DynamoDB → Bedrock → SES  
- Ensuring scalable deployments using CloudFormation and IaC patterns  

---

##  What I’m Learning & Improving (Architect Focus)
- Advanced system design for **large-scale AI workloads**  
- **VPC Lattice**, PrivateLink, and cross-account communication  
- High-performance vector databases and **retrieval optimization**  
- Architecting **zero-trust networks** and service-to-service authentication  
- Enterprise-level **monitoring & observability** using CloudWatch, X-Ray, and logs  
- Bedrock Agents with **complex action groups and multi-step reasoning**

##  How My Skills Help Tech Companies (Architect Value)

### Architect Better AI & Cloud Systems  
I build systems that are secure, scalable, cost-efficient, observable, and production-ready.

### Reduce Infrastructure & Operational Load  
Event-driven architectures minimize overhead, improve resiliency, and remove manual processes.

### Accelerate AI Adoption  
I integrate RAG pipelines, embeddings, and AI agent workflows into real products.

### Deliver Enterprise-Grade Reliability  
Designing architectures with:
- Isolated VPCs  
- PrivateLink communication  
- IAM identity boundaries  
- Multi-AZ redundancy  
- Monitoring and logging  
- Edge delivery caching  

### Full Ownership of Solutions  
From architecture → implementation → testing → deployment → monitoring.
