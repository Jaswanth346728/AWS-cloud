# AWS-cloud
I work on building AI-powered applications using Generative AI and AWS Cloud services. I develop RAG systems, AI assistants, and serverless automation using Amazon Bedrock, Lambda, DynamoDB, and OpenSearch. My focus is on creating scalable, secure, and real-world cloud solutions that integrate LLMs, embeddings, and intelligent workflows.
