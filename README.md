## Hi, I'm Jaswanth — Cloud & Generative AI Developer

I specialize in building **AI-powered applications** and **cloud-native systems** using AWS.  
My work focuses on **Generative AI**, **RAG pipelines**, **AI assistants**, and **serverless automation** using Amazon Bedrock, Lambda, OpenSearch, DynamoDB, and other AWS services.

---

## What I Do
- Build **RAG-based knowledge assistants** using Amazon Bedrock, Embeddings, and OpenSearch Serverless  
- Develop **serverless AI agents** using Bedrock Agents + Action Groups + Lambda  
- Design **real-time automation workflows** (email tasks, data retrieval, AI-driven actions)  
- Create **cloud-native architectures** using VPC, S3, DynamoDB, IAM, and Lambda  
- Build NLP and text-processing pipelines using **SageMaker, Textract, Comprehend, Translate, and Transcribe**  
- Develop secure, scalable backend systems using IAM, networking, and serverless patterns  

---

## What I’m Learning / Improving
- Advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
- Vector stores & embedding optimization with **OpenSearch Serverless**  
- Fine-tuning LLMs for enterprise use cases  
- Agentic AI workflows using **Amazon Bedrock Agents**  
- Multi-VPC networking, IAM boundaries, and service-to-service security  
- Scalable, event-driven architectures using Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB Streams  

---

## Technologies I Use
**AI & ML:**  
Amazon Bedrock (Agents, Knowledge Bases, Embeddings), SageMaker, Textract, Comprehend, Translate, Polly, Transcribe  

**Cloud:**  
AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, EC2, VPC, IAM, CloudWatch, SES, SNS, RDS  

**Architecture:**  
Serverless systems, VPC peering, high availability, secure IAM design, well-architected cloud patterns  

**Languages & Tools:**  
Python, Boto3, JSON, GitHub, Linux/CLI, CloudFormation

## What I Have Learned (From Projects + Resume)
- How to build **enterprise-grade RAG systems** using OpenSearch Serverless  
- How to design **vector-based semantic search** for unstructured data  
- How to build **AI agents that perform real actions** (send email, update records, retrieve knowledge)  
- How to build **multi-service automation pipelines** using Lambda, SES, S3  
- How to integrate **NLP, OCR, translation, sentiment analysis, TTS/STT**  
- How to design secure cloud networking with **VPC peering, route tables, and SGs**  
- How to apply AWS Well-Architected best practices to real workloads  

---

## How My Skills Help Tech Companies
### - Build smarter customer experiences  
AI agents that retrieve information, personalize results, automate tasks, and respond instantly.

### - Reduce operational workload  
Serverless automation eliminates manual processes and reduces maintenance costs.

### - Production-ready cloud systems  
Secure IAM roles, proper VPC design, scalable Lambda workloads, and well-architected patterns.

### - AI that integrates into real products  
Using RAG, embeddings, and agent actions, I can build assistants for:
- Food apps  
- E-commerce  
- Support chatbots  
- Knowledge retrieval systems  
- Workflow automation platforms  

### - Strong end-to-end engineering  
From cloud infrastructure → data retrieval → AI → email automation → monitoring.

##  My Goal
To build **intelligent, scalable, real-world AI systems** that help companies integrate LLMs, RAG, and serverless automation into production applications.
